  <h1>Steve's Potato</h1>
    <p>Welcome to a website all about me, Steve, and my beloved Potato! Yes, a capital P - that's how <strong>amazing</strong> it is! </p>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>It all started when I was enjoying my sad snack in an In-n-Out parking lot: the In-n-Out fry. I began to wonder where this awful creation was derived, to see if I could make it better. I immediately drove myself back through the drive though and demanded the ingredients. The woman at the drive through handed me none other than a potato - who would have thought?! Since that day, I have kept my Potato Pal in hopes that I can nurture him into a better french fry.</p>
